## Main web server

- We created JBrowse 2 instances for many species of interest (including human with hg19, hg38, and the T2T hs1 assembly) with jbrowse-plugin-protein3d and jbrowse-plugin-msaview loaded by default. You can
  right-click any gene-of-interest to launch an MSA or 3-D protein viewer
  https://genomes.jbrowse.org

## Other demos

- Ensembl Compara and TreeFam browser: This app provides a simple method to load
  data from Ensembl Compara Gene Trees and TreeFam into our app
  https://jbrowse.org/demos/msafam/
- Uniprot Browser: This app accesses the Uniprot API to get protein annotations
  https://cmdcolin.github.io/uniprot_browser

## JBrowse 2 plugins

We created two independent JBrowse 2 plugins to help connect the genome browser
to protein resources. Users can install these plugins via the in-app plugin
store, or administrators can install the plugin for all their users:

- [jbrowse-plugin-msaview](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-plugin-msaview) -
  programmatically integrates react-msaview into JBrowse 2 for re-use, allows
  querying NCBI BLAST
- [jbrowse-plugin-protein3d](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-plugin-protein3d) -
  programmatically integrates Mol\* 3-D protein structure views, allows querying
  AlphaFoldDB and UniProt
